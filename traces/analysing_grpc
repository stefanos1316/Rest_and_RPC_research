NETWORK TRACES

gRPC
====
Java spends almost 30% of its time on sendmmsg which is not the case for Go.
Also, Java spends 7% of its time on setsockopt command which not exist for Go.
Python sends 62.56% of its execution time on sendmsg and 37.31% on recvmsg, 
this is done only for Python while Go and JavaScript are mainly using socket and the connect syscalls (calling 1 time only)

RPC
===
Python is spending its major time on recvfrom and sendto network calls that are not happening for Go, Java, and JS.

REST
====
Java is spending most of its time on 55.47% recvfrom and 40.88% sendto network calls
Python is spending 37.53% of its time on recvfrom and 13.26% of its time on sendto network calls
JavaScript and Go which are the fastest and more energy efficient implementations are mainly using only connect and socket network calls.
